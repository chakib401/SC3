# Subspace Convolutional Co-Clustering

This repository is for reproducing experiments from :

- "Subspace Co-clustering with Two-Way Graph Convolution", that appeared in CIKM '22.
- "Boosting Subspace Co-clustering via Bilateral Graph Convolution", the extended version to appear in IEEE TKDE.

The code can be found in _run_experiments.ipynb_.
